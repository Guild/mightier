# Socrates

Socrates is a real-time markdown editor and previewer. Check out the [demo](http://socrates.io).

Although it updates in real time, its not a perfect etherpad. It behaves best when edited by a single person at a time. 

Socrates is designed to work without a server. It can be hosted on Github, S3, DreamHost, etc.
